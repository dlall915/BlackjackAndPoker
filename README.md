Like most Comp Sci students, I was very interested in some kind of GUI so I created this during my first year of classes as an honors project. I used [SDL](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Introduction) for the graphics. Keep in mind this was created before learning anything beyond the basics and before the emphasis on documentation. I'd like to take this idea and turn it into a mobile app at some point.
